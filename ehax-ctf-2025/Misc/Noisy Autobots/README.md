Decodicons really didn’t want us reading this QR code—it’s buried under a mess of noise. But we’re not out of luck. Bumblebee got a dataset full of noisy QR codes along with their clean versions.

Your job? Figure out how to use the dataset to restore the original QR code and reveal the hidden flag.

Can you clean up the noise and crack the code?
